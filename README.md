# Cherry-Berry

This is my first solo project focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript outside of school!

I wanted to do my own refresher of what i learned in my bootcamp so i decided to sort of follow the structure of the course and create small projects with notes taken in psuedocode
for my own reference!

I made the repository public just in case anyone stumbles across and digs the notes!

Using GitHub for my notes/examples also gives me the opportunity to get more reps in with pushes/pulls/etc.

Thanks for reading this far!
